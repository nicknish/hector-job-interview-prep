# Tic Tac Toe

Build a Tic Tac Toe game in React.

Here's an example of Tic Tac Toe: https://www.google.com/search?q=tic-tac-toe

## Requirements

The primary goals are:

1. Display a 3x3 game board on the screen.
2. Players can take turns to place an X or a O on the board.

The secondary goals are:

1. A player wins if three of their marks are in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
2. Display the current game status at the top: whose turn it is, winner (if any), or draw.
3. Add a "Reset" button to allow the game to be restarted at any time.

## Notes

- Do not focus on styling beyond the 3x3 grid and the chosen colors.
- Do not focus on building a computer player.
