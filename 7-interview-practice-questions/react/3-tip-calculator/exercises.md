# Tip Calculator

Implement a tip calculator. See [3-tip-calculator-preview.png](./3-tip-calculator-preview.png) for a
preview of what this looks like.

## Requirements

- The tip calculator should have 3 inputs, each with a label
  - Total: The total price of the bill (defaults to 50)
  - Tip percentage: The percentage that the user is tipping (defaults to 18%)
  - Number of people: The number of people splitting the bill (defaults to 1)
- The tip calculator should display a "Total Tip" amount.
- The tip calculator should display a "Tip per person" amount.
- You should not have to submit a form. As you change the inputs, the output values should
  recalculate.

## Notes

- Do not focus on styling.
